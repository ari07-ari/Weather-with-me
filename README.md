## Installation
I created a repository that I later cloned into my computer. I copied the develop folder and then moved the files into their folders, and then proceeded to code.

## Usage
The usage of this web application is to help the user plan and organize their activities in an hour-based schedule. The hours go from 9am to 5pm, and they can save their events and will main until they decide to remove them.
